## Introduction

Teppanyaki Kyoto Restaurant is one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants, recommended by many Japanese students.
Their signature okonomiyaki dish comes with many side options, and will surprise you every time with
new tastes of deliciousness.

## Connections

CMUJSA also holds most board mixers and dinners at this restaurant,
as it offers a large zashiki-style (sitting on the floor) seating for big groups like ours.
