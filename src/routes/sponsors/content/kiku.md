## Introduction

Kiku Japanese Restaurant was one of the first restaurants to introduce authentic Japanese sushi to Pittsburgh.
They serve a variety of traditional and modern Japanese dishes, while maintaining their high standards as an original sushi restaurant.
The name comes from the Japanese word for chrysanthemum, _Ëèä_, a beautiful flower that is cherished in Japan.

## Connections

Kiku is another favorite Japanese restaurant for CMU students, for it's high quality food at a fancy location.
This is Kiku's first year as a sponsor for CMUJSA, supporting us as a <font color="Silver">Silver Tier Sponsor</font> for Matsuri 2018.
