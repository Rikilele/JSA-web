## Introduction

Tokyo Japanese Store is a store located on Ellsworth Avenue, specializing in high quality Japanese food and items.
They have everything in store from raw vegetables and meat commonly used in Japanese dishes, to beautiful Japanese dishes and utensils.

## Connections

Members of CMUJSA regularly buy their every day supplies from Tokyo,
as they have the most authentic list of items available.

Many CMUJSA fundraisers are also supported by Tokyo, as some condiments for served dishes are only readily available here.

Tokyo Japanese Store had been a regular sponsor for our Matsuri event several years back, 
and have generously offered to restore the sponsorship in 2018.
They show their support as a <font color="Silver">Silver Tier Sponsor</font> for Matsuri 2018,
through abundant supplies of snacks and food ingredients used for the event.

## Location

Take the 75 from the Fifth Ave. at Craig St. bus stop for a 5 minute ride to the store!
