## Introduction

big Burrito has a wide range of restaurants that span from more traditional Japanese fare to casual Mexican creations and contemporary kitchens.
While diverse in flavors, each has a commonality of a commitment to quality ingredients and innovative dishes.

## Connections

big Burrito's _Umi_ is of particular interest to CMUJSA students,
as a high-end Japanese restaurant located near campus.

big Burrito has generously sponsored us for several of our Matsuri events, the most recent being in 2016.
This year, they have decided to show their enhanced support as a <font color="Silver">Silver Tier Sponsor</font> for Matsuri 2018.
