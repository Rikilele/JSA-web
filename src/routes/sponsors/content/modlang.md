## Introduction

The Department of Modern Languages at the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University,
offers 7 different language curricula in their undergraduate program.
Japanese is one of their most popular languages, as the department provides seven levels of Japanese lectures to more than 170 students each semester. 
A lot of non-Japanese CMUJSA members take these courses to apply their knowledge to our activities.

The Department of Modern Language has generously sponsored us each year, funding events such as the Japanese Culture Month and Matsuri.
This year, they continue to show their support as a <font color="Gold">Gold Tier Sponsor</font> for Matsuri 2018.
