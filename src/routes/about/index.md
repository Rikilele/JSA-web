# About Us

We are the Japanese Student Association at Carnegie Mellon University (CMUJSA).
CMUJSA is a student organization dedicated to spreading awareness of Japanese culture throughout the student body, as well as the greater Pittsburgh community.
To fulfill our objective, we host numerous events related to Japanese culture, the largest of which is Matsuri.
